### Professional Summary

I am currently a Masters student at the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellong University. My interest lies in exploring Machine Learning as a tool to solve real-world problems especially related to Natural Language Processing.

Before this, I was working as a data scientist in Goldman Sachs for the past three years to build end-to-end Machine learning pipelines that help automate production management for the firm.

My experience spans from building an ML system that can incorporate human feedback optimally to improve unsupervised baselines through a "human-in-the-loop" techniques - to building big data pipelines leveraging Hadoop that enables such systems. I am excited about practical ML systems that incorporate domain/tacit knowledge of its user utilizing intelligent UX and modelling ideas.

In the past, I have done projects in Non-linear dimensionality reduction and NLP with a focus on adding priors like domain knowledge or geometric intuitions to improve data-driven algorithms.

I do like to dabble in amateur writing at my [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@atabakashfaq)
